* What are _tags_ ?
  Let say we have an org file looks like this:

  #+begin_src org
    ,#+TAGS[]: a b c
    ,#+tags: x y z

    blah blah...
  #+end_src

  The above has tags: a, b, c, x, y and z. These syntaxes are called
  "[[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Per_002dfile-keywords][Per file keywords]]".

  ~org-more.el~ does searching case-insensitively and support both
  ~#+tags[]:~ and ~#+tags:~. Also it gathers every tag lines of a
  file.
